# Percolations

Programming assignment [from week1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home/week/1)
of Princeton University's [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) course
implemented in Rust

[Task specification](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php)

My own Disjoint-set-union [implementation](../rust_algo_toolbox/src/union_find) is used to perform fast test
whether two grid cells are in the same 4-connected component.
